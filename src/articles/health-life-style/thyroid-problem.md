> Wanted to share how my wife thyroid issue was solved without taking any medicine and how our life changed after that. 

I should start with an incident that happened 2 years back.
I wanted to share my experience and hope this reading will help someone who has first time thyroid issues and the ways to solve any such health issues. It's my experience and won't say that this is the solution to solve it.
 
On a Saturday night 2 years back, around 11:30 PM suddenly my wife noticed feeling her heartbeat. When I say feeling her heartbeat, she was able to hear her own heartbeat. We checked her Fitbit app and was shocked seeing her heart rate was around 190. Normally it would be around 80 to 90. it took 30-45 mins to get normal and we felt it could be of air in the house and we even went out of the house to have fresh oxygen. As time passed, she felt that once again and lasted around 1hr. We are not sure what’s happening. She was not feeling anything bad because of that increasing in heart rate. 

We consulted the doctor and had all different test from blood to ECG and found all the result are normal, Except Thyroid which was little less than normal. I asked the doctor what the reason was for thyroid issue. Doctor told me that they are not sure why people get it, but it's common in American and is being noticed these days a lot. Need to take medicine for life long for thyroid. I was surprised for the answer. I read on the articles what causes and what are the impact of Thyroid.

I and my wife decided to take some changes in our lifestyle and see if that work and then decide of taking medicine.

I started noting down what is thyroid and what causes thyroid issue. As thyroid is a gland that ejects hormones which is a managed by complex structure of body and body know when to eject and not to eject. If we start taking medicine and force body to eject and slowly the gland expects medicine always to produce. How really is this right to feed the body with medicine every day. The main problem that we went for was heartbeat but came out with this issue. Am I thinking too much, not sure?

So, I sorted out what was the daily route of my wife and considered the 4 most important things that body needs.

* Air and sun light
* Water
* Food
* Exercise

### Walking or Yoga
I asked my wife to go for walk every day at least for 30mins. Once I am back from office, I used to ask her if she went for walking. 
If not, we both used to go for walk.  In winters it’s hard to go for walk, as it gets dark and cold early, so we used to do yoga and basic exercise daily. 

when I say daily it not mandate that we did every day. But did at least 4 times in a week. Something is better than nothing.

### In-door plans
In USA as houses are so closed due to the climatic conditions. I decided to grow indoor plants.

I was in an assumption that we normally drink more water and never thought about it. Will come back to that later.

Whenever we discussed this with our cousin, they used to suggest taking medicine, if not we may have problem when we try for pregnancy. That used to scare me, but I used to convince my wife saying, how can we take a medicine that never says the real reason for the cause and how long should we take medicine. It doesn’t make any sense.

 *Daily habit of walking was added into our lifestyle, Indoor plants into our houses, eating organic fruits into our diet and Never took a medicine for one year and continued to do all the steps above. *

After a year we had the thyroid test and found it normal. checked it even after 2nd year it was normal. We just gave body what it wants and gave some time. 

But suddenly two weeks back my wife again had the palpitations on June 6th and 14th 2020 and she was pregnant, that scared me the most. Consulted our doctor through phone and did all the ECG tests again. Doctor was saying everything looks normal. 

Still all the above habits are being done day to day. Suddenly one of my cousin told that he had heard of the same palpitation problem for one of the famous telugu actor Harsha Vardhan ( Telugu Amrutham serial hero) in one of his interview. I searched for that interview and found that was the same symptoms and his too faced same problem many doctors saying all tests looks good. Finally, one doctor checked his all-day to day routine and told that Dehydration problem.

### What is Hydration?

Drinking water is hydration. We should make sure we drink sufficient amount of water that body needs, if not we call it as dehydration problem.

We tried to track how much water my wife drank of June 6th, 14th and found as some relatives visited to our house, she didn’t drink at least 1 bottle of water on 6th and 14th. 

That surprised me, we always used to think we drink lot water. To be frank we never drink at least 2 liters of water a day. Try starting to count how many bottles we drink every day.

> I am a strong believer of a saying: "Every problem is caused due to silly common-sense mistakes that we make."

We are on average drinking 3 liters of water these days and never seen any palpitation. Will update this article if any new observations.

I am not trying to say not to take medicines. Medicines are to be taken when you do not have time to solve the problem and think wise before you take a decision considering the pros and cons.
