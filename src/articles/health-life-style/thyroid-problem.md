I should start with an incident that happened 2 years back.
I wanted to share my experience and hope this reading will help some one in knowing what is rigth and wrong when it comes to health and lifestyle 
 
2 years back, On a staturday night Me, my wife and my friends played Settlers of catan board game until 11:30pm and I and my wife came back to my home and were getting ready to sleep. Suddenly my wife noticed that she was able to feel her heart beat. When I say feel, She was able to hear her own heart beat. We checked her fitbot app and was shocked seeing her heart rate was around 190. Normally it would be around 80 to 90
