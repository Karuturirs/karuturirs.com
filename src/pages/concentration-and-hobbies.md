Hobbies are important aspects that make us better. These days every one is so good at doing manythings at one go. Can we really concentrate on one thing at a time. I am sure not for a long time.

When we eat we only need to concentrate on eating,But we get diverted by watching mobile or netfix. Doing so will always make our mind not to know how muchwe eat. There are many things that we do so. 

Reading a book or blog with out reacting to mobile notifications sounds is also a hard thing to control.
The point here is, with the current fast growing technological world every one is lacking the capacity to concentrate for long on what they do.

Can we really do one thing at a given point of time for long. This is not achivable so easily with out practice.

By practicing concentration would lead every one to be a great person on anything that they do.

Hobbies as one of the elements that would lead you to practice concentartion.

Try it out and let me know if you agree.
