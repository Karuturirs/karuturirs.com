Hobbies are the important things that make you better. I know these days every one is so good at doing manythings at one go. Can we really concentrate on one thing at a time.

when we eat we only need to concentrate on eating, not but watching a mobie on netfix and eat.

Reading a boo with out answering mobile notifications. can we really do that?

There could be many things that i can go on listed.

Can we do one thing at a given point of time. That will help us to practice concentration.

By practicing concentration would leed you to be a great person on anything you do you best.

Hobbies would lead you to practice concentartion.

Try it out and let me know if you agree.
